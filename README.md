# Inventory Forecasting & Sales Analysis Project

A self-initiated academic-style project simulating a retail inventory planning environment using synthetic sales data. The project applies data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and basic forecasting techniques to evaluate product and vendor performance across a simulated 12-month period.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives
- Clean and explore SKU-level sales data
- Identify top-performing products and vendors
- Detect stockout trends and weekly demand fluctuations
- Forecast demand for selected SKUs using moving averages
- Lay the foundation for inventory strategy modeling

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy
- **Jupyter Notebook**: for data cleaning and forecasting workflows
- **Excel** (planned): for inventory calculations and dashboards
- **Power BI** (planned): for interactive visuals and business storytelling

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights

- SKU_0204 had the highest total annual sales and was used for demand forecasting
- Vendor_2 led in overall sales volume, suggesting reliable replenishment
- Several SKUs exhibited frequent stockouts and should be evaluated for action
- Forecasting with 3-week moving averages achieved MAE: 6.74 and RMSE: 8.04
